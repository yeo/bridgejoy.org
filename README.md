I was suffering so I donâ€™t want anyone to have to walk the road that I went through.

Bridge Joy Foundation is run by Quynh and Vinh. We're looking to improve the state of the world, one bridge at a time. We aim to connect people to education. One chance at a time. A chance for a better life.

We made small but regular donations to any non profit organizations that aims to help children escape poverty and have a better life.
